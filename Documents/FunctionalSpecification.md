## Describing the current situation
We, as a team setting up our environment to startup our group project with the following developing members:
1. Sabri Said
2. Yang Yizhou
3. Deji Adeyemo
4. Imad
5. Om Parkash
6. Silabela Mxolisi

We have agreed to develop an Airline Ticket Reservation System. The application will have a simple login as well as point booking. Currently we are working on documentation which is an integral part of our application. This will give us ideas so that we will have a better understanding when it comes to implementation of our project. The application will be used by both airline admin and users who want to book in order to keep better track of inventory and help the owners manage their administration in a simple way. 

## UI Plan

The interface will be a not so complicated one, a simple login screen and logout and sign up and a dashboard that will have buttons such as; search, etc.and some labels and checklists such as : adult,child,find cheapest flight.
database MySql will be used for this project to store all the information get entered by the user, everything will be hardcoded into the project. With this simple design we aim to provide an easy interface that doesnt require much training leaving less stress on the owners to train new employees. 
after payment there will be a form that shows passenger details and payment ones such as;flight id,Passenger name,seat name, etc.
