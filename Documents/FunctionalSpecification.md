## Describing the current situation
We, as a team setting up our environment to startup our group project with the following developing members:
1. Sabri Said
2. Yang Yizhou
3. Deji Adeyemo
4. Imad
5. Om Parkash
6. Silabela Mxolisi

We have agreed to develop an Airline Ticket Reservation System. The application will have a simple login as well as point booking. Currently we are working on documentation which is an integral part of our application. This will give us ideas so that we will have a better understanding when it comes to implementation of our project. The application will be used by both airline admin and users who want to book in order to keep better track of inventory and help the owners manage their administration in a simple way. 

## Dream System 

The aim of this software is to develop a systematic analysis of the procedure involved
in the reservation of ticket for Airway travel. This should be used in an effective way so that
various advantages are obtained from the software.
The “Airline Ticket Reservation System” undertakes as a project 
based on relevant technologies. The main aim of this project is to develop the software for the
process of reserving airway ticket should lead to increased efficiency and reduced drawbacks
which were present in the previous procedure of airline reservation.The software should be,
error controlled both logically as well as in syntactic manner.

## Script

User can input locations then the application will show the ticket information for all available airline company
then User would like to search every ticket information and choose a good ticket,simply click book button
user can also reset the locations have inputed to check informations for other airlines
If user find good ticket ,they can pay for it

## List of requirements

input - The input function get locations from user
search - The search function get the information from database according to the locations inputed 
login - The login function let user login according to information from database
logout - The login function let user logout
sign up - The sign up function add user information to database
pay - The pay funtion help user order the ticket
check - the check function can check the user's oder and show any details of that function

## UI Plan

The interface will be a not so complicated one, a simple login screen and logout and sign up and a dashboard that will have buttons such as; search, etc.and some labels and checklists such as : adult,child,find cheapest flight.
database MySql will be used for this project to store all the information get entered by the user, everything will be hardcoded into the project. With this simple design we aim to provide an easy interface that doesnt require much training leaving less stress on the owners to train new employees. 
after payment there will be a form that shows passenger details and payment ones such as;flight id,Passenger name,seat name, etc.
Input: Collecting the information of the person who is going to travel.
Output: The issue of ticket on the particular date specified by the traveler. 

## How the system should be and what it should not be  ?__

The system should be as simple as we can make it so that the user can easily use it,otherwise,it shouldn't be broken at any point,always working properly(maintenance) which means we should maintain our application to work properly and if any error shows up we have to catch it(for example : try,catch exception).

Data requirements must be accurate, reliable and true. When you make an action request, such as finding, deleting, modifying, and adding, you should ensure that the input data matches the database data. When meeting the user's request, the system should ensure that the data in response to the inspection rate and accuracy rate.

Time characteristics. 
In order to meet the user's efficient requirements, the response time of the data, the update processing time, the data conversion and transmission time, the running time should be within 1-5 seconds. When you need to interact with an external device, such as a printer, the response time may be long, but it should be within acceptable limits.

The systems UI should be simple enough for a person to find out how it works just by looking at it.

* The operating system : Microsoft Windows 10.
* the programming language, databases;
* coding standards;
* business logic, etc.
The application should have methods and function that can do all the operations needed like update reservation or cancel it...etc also,it should have forms.
