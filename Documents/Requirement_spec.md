airline ticket online.
We chose netbeans as a text editor or an envirement to use and make our project in because that's the most and easiest thing that is 
used by many programmers.
The application can do a lot of stuff for the users such :
* book or reserve a flight ticket and this can be for adults or childreen.
* this app will make it very easy for the user to use an online tool to book for a ticket 
rather than going out and book it where usually its crowded.

# Intended audience

It can be Students, teachers, community members, et cetera.

__Project outline__

The project is a simple application which can allow the users to book their ticket online.
There shall be java classes like Payment, Seat and forms that will make it easy
for the users to understand the application.
this app actually will make the junior developers knowledge and allowing 
them to contribute a lot to the projects' development. by using classes we can divide the work into neat bundles 
of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. Having a class for "Customers" having 
to string methods which can be printed on the till slip for example. Simple functionality that will make code 
neater throughout the entire project. All and all the project is a very simple one.
