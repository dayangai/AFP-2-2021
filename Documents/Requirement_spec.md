![app](/images/airline.png)

__Purpose__

The purpose of this project is to make an application that will let the user to book an 
airline ticket online.
We chose netbeans as a text editor or an envirement to use and make our project in because that's the most and easiest thing that is 
used by many programmers.
The application can do a lot of stuff for the users such :
* book or reserve a flight ticket and this can be for adults or childreen.
* this app will make it very easy for the user to use an online tool to book for a ticket 
rather than going out and book it where usually its crowded.

# Intended audience

Intended to be used by anyone that wants to book an online ticket. 
It can be Students, teachers, community members, et cetera.

__Project outline__

The project is a simple application which can allow the users to book their ticket online.
There shall be java classes like Payment, Seat and forms that will make it easy
for the users to understand the application.
this app actually will make the junior developers knowledge and allowing 
them to contribute a lot to the projects' development. by using classes we can divide the work into neat bundles 
of code which offer a lot of functionality while still being very readable. Having a class for "Customers" having 
to string methods which can be printed on the till slip for example. Simple functionality that will make code 
neater throughout the entire project. All and all the project is a very simple one.

__Current Situatuin__

As the world gets more and more efficent technology needs to move along with it, and so we have the idea to create an application that will make it very easy for the user to book a flight ticket,for now,we have decided how the project should look like and we have got a team of 6 people who will be working on it.

__Goal__

One of the goal is to know how to be a part of a team in the software industry, through some controlling tools like git, GitHub, and gitLab, 
also to get to use the task manager websites like Trello.com, and spread the tasks for each member of the team. 
the main goal is life of both the the user and the admin easier(user can book a ticket,admin can handle the other stuff like give back the information of the ticket and receipt)
Our hopes is to streamline the checkout process with this software which can help out our users.
