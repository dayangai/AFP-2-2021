![app](/images/1000.png)

__Purpose__

The purpose of this project is to make an android application that will detect or recognize the amount of money that is given.
We chose android application as a platform to use and deploy our project in because that's the most and easiest thing that is 
used by a lot of people.
The application can do a lot of stuff for the users such :
* recognize how much money is given in order to implement some operations like addition, subtraction....
* this app can be more developed and can be used in so many fields like cashier machine, this technology will make it easier
for the user to count how much money is given and how much should be given back or money that's given is not enough.

# Intended audience

Intended to be used by anyone that has access to internet and has any issue with detecting the amount of money. 
It can be Students, teachers, community members, et cetera.

__Project outline__

The project is a simple android application which can allow the users to detect how much money is in there.
there shall be java classes like CameraActivity class that has some methods like requestpermission which allows us to access to the user's camera
in order to detect the money,there shall also be some threads that can run multiple functions at the same time because our app doesn't only 
detect the money is shown by writing but also by a voice call that simply says how mush money is there.
this app actually will make the junior developers knowledge and allowing 
them to contribute alot to the projects development. by using classes we can divide the work into neat bundles 
of code which offer alot of functionality while stil being very readable. Having a class for "CameraActivity" having 
tostring methods which can be printed on the till slip for example. simple functionality that will make code 
neater throughout the entire project. All and all the project is a very simple one.
