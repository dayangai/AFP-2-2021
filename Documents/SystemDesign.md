## Introduction

A high-level summary, which all members in the group should understand and decide,
if it's helpful for them to read other documents.
The necessity of the project, what to do with evaluating the project itself, the description of the problem and how all these
make the team work together with a strategy

## Purpose and Goals

This application should be made because nowadays so many don't like to book their flight ticket offline where usually its crowded and it takes a lot of time and effort,
which is a kind of a traditional way to deal with customers,
so for that we need this application that will make it easier and with less effort. goal is to make the life of both customer and servant easier with an application which is easy to use and easy to train employees with. Our hopes is to streamline the checkout process with this software which can help out our employees.

## Proposed Scope\Architecture

  #### Architecture:

        The system will be developed in java. Using classes, having methods that can implement the CRUD methods,for example cancel a ticket.
        The database connection is a must for this project to keeo track of all the information entered by the user(Mysql xampp could be a good thing for this project) 
        Have a user interface which will contain the general information, username, id password etc, and have two implementations of the interface which will be admin and user, by this way we can control the permissions each user has. the design will include buttons and text boxes to insert texts and numbers and forms as well.

#### Design:
        Image background on the screen as well as buttons with different colors. buttons for like, login,logout,back,proceed..etc . A form for the user to show the flight ticket information or details and another form for the admin to keep track of the users. we also require a sign up and login form which will follow the same design patterns as the previously afore mentioned forms. 

##### Functionality:
        First page will have a well designed regestration system page. After which the user will be redirected to their supposed forms, I.e the admin will be directied to the users management form and the user will be taken to the booking flight form where they can fill up the information required.
